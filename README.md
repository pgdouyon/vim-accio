Accio
=====

Accio asynchronously *summons* build/compiler/linter output to your screen by
wrapping the `:compiler` and `:make` commands with [Neovim][]'s job control
API and Vim 8's job API.  Output from these programs is displayed in the
following ways:

- Populating the quickfix list
- Placing signs on the error lines
- Echoing the error message when the cursor is on an error line.

Note: Vim 8's asynchronous API appears to still be unstable at the time of this
writing and causes occasional seg faults.  I've increased the update interval
to try and account for it but use with caution and try not to issue too many
Accio commands in a short span of time.


Usage
-----

Accio doesn't provide any pre-configured compilers/syntax checkers, instead it
utilizes compiler plugins to run whatever build/compiler/linter programs they
specify and parse their output.  Vim ships with several compiler plugins but
writing your own is fairly straightforward (`:h write-compiler-plugin`).

To run a single compiler plugin just pass its name to Accio:

- i.e. `:Accio javac`

To run multiple compiler plugins at once and aggregate their results into one
quickfix list, pass a list of compiler names to Accio:

- i.e. `:Accio ["javac", "checkstyle"]`
- Note: the compiler names must be quoted, otherwise Vim will attempt to
  resolve them as variable names and throw an error

Adding support for a new compiler is as simple as writing a compiler plugin for
it and storing it under `$HOME/.vim/compiler/` or `$HOME/vimfiles/compiler` for
Windows.

Accio is not limited to compiler plugins designed to analyze a single file.  It
can run any compiler plugin, even ones that kick off a project build script.
Accio should be able to handle it and load the results into the quickfix list
asynchronously.


#### Javac Example

Vim ships with a javac compiler, but it provides no way to specify the
classpath javac should use, instead it relies on the `$CLASSPATH` environment
variable being set up correctly.  Unfortunately, this scheme doesn't work well
if you're working on multiple Java projects where each project has its own
classpath.

One solution is to use a compiler plugin to help determine the classpath for
each individual buffer.  Below is an example javac compiler plugin for
determining the classpath in a maven project with Git as the VCS and using
Fugitive to locate the project root folder:

```vim
let current_compiler = "IntelliJ"

function! s:get_classpath()
    let project_git_dir = fugitive#extract_git_dir(expand("%:p"))
    let project_root = fnamemodify(project_git_dir, ":h")
    let classpath_cmd = printf("cd %s && mvn dependency:build-classpath", shellescape(project_root))
    let classpath_pattern = 'classpath:\n\zs[^[].\{-\}\ze\n'
    let maven_output = system(classpath_cmd)
    let maven_classes = project_root . "/target/classes:"
    let classpath = maven_classes . matchstr(maven_output, classpath_pattern)
    return classpath
endfunction

if !exists("b:loaded_javac_classpath")
    let b:loaded_javac_classpath = s:get_classpath()
endif

if exists(":CompilerSet") != 2		" older Vim always used :setlocal
  command -nargs=* CompilerSet setlocal <args>
endif

let $CLASSPATH=b:loaded_javac_classpath
CompilerSet makeprg=javac
CompilerSet errorformat=%E%f:%l:\ %m,%-Z%p^,%-C%.%#,%-G%.%#
```

Save this script to `$HOME/.vim/compiler/IntelliJ.vim` and it can be run
through Accio with the command `:Accio IntelliJ %`.


#### Configuration and Features

- `<Plug>AccioPrevWarning` and `<Plug>AccioNextWarning`
    - Mappings to jump to the previous/next error line.
    - By default these are mapped to `[w` and `]w` (mnemonic: warning).
- `accio#statusline()`
    - Statusline function that will report the number of errors in the current
      buffer.
    - Example usage: `set statusline+=%#WarningMsg#%{accio#statusline()}%*`
- `g:accio_auto_copen`
    - Set to 1 to automatically open the quickfix list when the Accio command
      is invoked, 0 otherwise.
- `g:accio_create_empty_quickfix`
    - Set to 0 to prevent Accio from creating new quickfix lists when there are
      no errors to report (Accio reuses its own quickfix lists), 1 otherwise.
- `g:accio_update_interval`
    - Length of the interval, in milliseconds, between updates to the quickfix
      list and displayed signs


### Differences from [Neomake][]

Neomake is essentially a superset of Accio and there's really no reason to use
Accio over Neomake unless you're a control freak like me with an irrational
hatred of pre-configured makers.

My plan for Accio is to be a lightweight alternative to Neomake that hopefully
feels like it gives more control/flexibility over your compilers/linters.

The other main difference between the two plugins is that Neomake uses both the
quickfix list and location list depending on which version of the command you
run.  Accio will only use the quickfix list for all possible invocations.

- I've put a lot of thought into it and come to the conclusion that the
transience of location lists are not a good fit for asynchronous
operation or error reporting.
- If anyone ever ends up actually using this plugin I would still entertain
arguments in favor of the location list, just open up an issue about it.
- For anyone worried about Accio trashing their quickfix list, Accio makes
an effort to reuse the quickfix list wherever possible.

**Note:** Neomake does support compiler plugins in addition to pre-configured
makers, but you still have to run the `:compiler` command separately.  Accio
saves a step by bundling the `:compiler` and `:make` commands into one.

- If you want to use more than one compiler plugin, you can't get around
    this by setting the compiler per filetype.
